# Maryland Elder Population Health Analysis
As a final capstone, this project was developed for BMI 6318: Big Data in Biomedical Informatics. It analyzes synthetic patient data to identify areas where the State of Maryland could provide targeted healthcare support for its older adult population.

## Overview
Using big data techniques and real-world inspired datasets (~53,000 patients, 14+ GB), we mapped a broad business question to a focused analytical design. The final output includes both a high-level executive summary for policymakers and a technical breakdown for junior data scientists.
